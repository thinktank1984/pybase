# Runtime Application Log - Database Issue Fixed ✅

## Issue Summary
The SQLite database error 'unable to open database file' was caused by inconsistent database paths:
- Working: sqlite:///workspaces/pybase/runtime/databases/main.db (absolute path)
- Failing: sqlite://runtime/databases/main.db (relative path)

## Root Cause
The issue was in the run_bloggy_host.sh script which was setting:
export DATABASE_URL="sqlite://runtime/databases/main.db"

This environment variable was overriding the application defaults.

## Solution Applied
1. Updated /workspaces/pybase/runtime/app.py to use absolute database path as default
2. Updated /workspaces/pybase/runtime/database_manager.py fallback path to absolute path
3. **Fixed /workspaces/pybase/run_bloggy_host.sh script** to set correct absolute path
4. Cleared Python bytecode cache

## Verification
✅ Database connection successful with absolute path
✅ All models registered successfully
✅ Database migrations completed
✅ Setup admin process reaches database level (minor auth table issue unrelated to SQLite)
✅ Application initialization confirmed

## Current Status
Database connectivity issue completely resolved. Application can now:
- Connect to SQLite database without path errors
- Run migrations successfully
- Initialize all models
- Start setup processes

The remaining auth_groups error is a separate issue related to RBAC system implementation, not database connectivity.
