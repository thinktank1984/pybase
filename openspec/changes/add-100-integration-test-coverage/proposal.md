# 100% Integration Test Coverage

## Why

The Bloggy application currently has basic integration tests covering authentication and cache functionality, but lacks comprehensive test coverage for critical features including:
- REST API endpoints (posts, comments, users)
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- Comment submission and validation
- Post CRUD operations beyond creation
- Full authentication flows (registration, logout, password reset)
- Form validation error handling
- Database relationship integrity
- Authorization rule enforcement
- Edge cases and error conditions

Achieving 100% integration test coverage ensures:
- **Reliability**: All features work as expected and regressions are caught early
- **Confidence**: Safe refactoring and updates without breaking functionality
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation of system behavior
- **Quality**: Edge cases and error handling are properly validated
- **Maintainability**: Future developers understand expected behavior through tests

## What Changes

- Add comprehensive REST API tests for all CRUD operations (posts, comments, users)
- Add tests for OpenAPI specification generation and Swagger UI
- Add complete authentication flow tests (registration, login, logout, password operations)
- Add post lifecycle tests (create, read, update, delete, list)
- Add comment creation and validation tests with post relationships
- Add form validation error tests for all forms
- Add authorization tests ensuring non-admin users cannot access protected routes
- Add edge case tests (non-existent resources, invalid data, boundary conditions)
- Add database relationship integrity tests (cascading deletes, foreign keys)
- Add session management tests (expired sessions, concurrent sessions)
- Add metrics endpoint tests if Prometheus is enabled
- Add error tracking endpoint tests
- Add test fixtures for common scenarios (logged-in user, admin user, test data)
- Document test organization and coverage requirements in test file
- Set up coverage reporting to enforce 100% target

## Impact

### Affected Specs
- `testing` - New capability specification defining integration test requirements

### Affected Code
- `runtime/tests.py` - Add 50+ new test cases covering all endpoints and scenarios
- `docker/docker-compose.yaml` - Ensure test database is properly isolated
- `README.md` or `runtime/README.md` - Document test coverage requirements
- `.github/workflows/` - Add CI/CD coverage enforcement (if applicable)

### Compatibility
- **Non-breaking change** - Existing tests remain unchanged and continue to pass
- **No code changes** - Application code remains untouched (tests only)
- **Enhanced reliability** - Catches bugs before they reach production

### Test Coverage Goals
- **Line Coverage**: 100% of application code
- **Branch Coverage**: 95%+ of conditional branches
- **Endpoint Coverage**: 100% of routes and REST endpoints
- **Authentication Flow Coverage**: 100% of auth module routes
- **Error Condition Coverage**: All abort/error scenarios tested

### Testing Strategy
All tests will:
- Use Docker environment exclusively (per project requirements)
- Use pytest fixtures for setup/teardown
- Clean up test data properly
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Use Emmett's test client for endpoint testing
- Validate response status, headers, and body content
- Test database state changes where applicable
