## Notes

### Test Organization
- Group tests by feature area using comments or test classes
- Follow naming convention: `test_<feature>_<scenario>`
- Keep related tests together for easier maintenance

### Docker Testing
- All tests must run in Docker: `docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yaml exec runtime pytest tests.py`
- Test database must be isolated from development database
- Use environment variables for test configuration

### Coverage Configuration
```ini
# pytest.ini or pyproject.toml
[tool:pytest]
testpaths = tests.py
addopts = --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=html --cov-fail-under=95
```

### Excluded from Coverage
- Test files themselves
- Migration files
- Setup/deployment scripts
- Third-party extensions

### Priority
High priority tests (complete first):
- All route handlers (100% endpoint coverage)
- REST API CRUD operations
- Authentication flows
- Authorization rules

Medium priority:
- Edge cases and error handling
- Database relationships
- Session management

Lower priority (nice-to-have):
- Metrics endpoint (depends on Prometheus being enabled)
- Error tracking endpoints (test-only routes)
- Documentation endpoints (static content)
