- **THEN** unused imports SHALL be removed
- **AND** imports SHALL be grouped (stdlib, third-party, local)
- **AND** imports SHALL be sorted alphabetically within groups

### Requirement: Dead Code Elimination
Code that is not used SHALL be removed to reduce maintenance burden and cognitive load.

#### Scenario: Unused function removal
- **WHEN** a function has zero call sites in the codebase

- **THEN** it SHALL be removed

#### Scenario: Unused class removal
- **WHEN** a class has zero instantiations in the codebase
- **AND** it is not part of a public API  
- **AND** it is not referenced in documentation
- **THEN** it SHALL be removed

#### Scenario: Dead code verification
- **WHEN** removing potentially unused code
- **THEN** a thorough search for usages MUST be performed
- **AND** test suite MUST pass after removal
- **AND** rationale for removal MUST be documented

### Requirement: Module Consolidation
Related utilities SHALL be consolidated into cohesive modules to reduce file proliferation.

#### Scenario: Token utility consolidation
- **WHEN** `auth/tokens.py` and `auth/token_refresh.py` have overlapping concerns
- **THEN** they SHOULD be consolidated into a single `auth/tokens.py` module
- **AND** all token-related functionality SHALL be in one place

#### Scenario: OAuth provider simplification
- **WHEN** OAuth providers have duplicate code patterns
- **THEN** common patterns SHALL be extracted to `auth/providers/base.py`
- **AND** individual providers SHALL contain only provider-specific configuration and overrides

#### Scenario: Utility evaluation criteria
- **WHEN** evaluating whether to keep a utility file
- **THEN** it MUST be used in production code, OR
- **THEN** it MUST be a documented development tool, OR
- **THEN** it SHOULD be moved to `tests/` if test-only, OR
- **THEN** it SHOULD be removed if unused

### Requirement: Documentation Currency
Documentation SHALL accurately reflect the current codebase structure and organization.

#### Scenario: Model documentation updates
- **WHEN** model structure changes
- **THEN** `models/README.md` SHALL be updated to reflect the changes
- **AND** examples SHALL match the actual code structure

#### Scenario: Project structure documentation
- **WHEN** files are moved, renamed, or removed
- **THEN** `openspec/project.md` SHALL be updated
- **AND** `AGENTS.md` SHALL be updated if it references changed files
- **AND** a summary document SHALL document all changes

#### Scenario: Code organization guide
- **WHEN** simplification refactoring is complete
- **THEN** a `documentation/code_organization.md` file SHALL exist
- **AND** it SHALL document the rationale for the structure
- **AND** it SHALL provide guidance for future additions

### Requirement: Refactoring Safety
All refactoring MUST preserve existing functionality and test coverage.

#### Scenario: Test preservation
- **WHEN** any refactoring change is made
- **THEN** all existing tests MUST still pass
- **AND** test coverage MUST NOT decrease
- **AND** tests MUST be run after each significant change

#### Scenario: Functionality preservation  
- **WHEN** code is moved, merged, or removed
- **THEN** all external APIs MUST remain functional
- **AND** all routes MUST remain accessible
- **AND** all REST API endpoints MUST work identically

#### Scenario: Incremental changes with rollback
- **WHEN** implementing simplification changes
- **THEN** changes SHALL be made in small increments
- **AND** each increment SHALL be committed separately
- **AND** each commit SHALL be revertible independently

### Requirement: Metrics Tracking
Simplification improvements SHALL be measurable with quantifiable metrics.

#### Scenario: File count reduction
- **WHEN** simplification is complete
- **THEN** total file count in `runtime/` SHALL be reduced by at least 20%
- **AND** reduction SHALL be documented with before/after counts

#### Scenario: Code count reduction
- **WHEN** simplification is complete  
- **THEN** total function and class count SHALL be reduced by at least 10%
- **AND** this SHALL be achieved through consolidation and dead code removal
- **AND** NOT by removing required functionality

#### Scenario: Complexity metrics
- **WHEN** measuring refactoring success
- **THEN** metrics SHALL include: file count, function count, lines of code, test coverage
- **AND** all metrics SHALL be documented in `SIMPLIFICATION_SUMMARY.md`
- **AND** summary SHALL explain rationale for all changes
