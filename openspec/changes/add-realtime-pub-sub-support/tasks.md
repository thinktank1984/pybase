# Implementation Tasks: Add Realtime Pub/Sub Support

## 1. Core Infrastructure
- [ ] 1.1 Create `runtime/realtime_broker.py` with subscription management
- [ ] 1.2 Implement client connection tracking with unique connection IDs
- [ ] 1.3 Add subscription registry mapping collection patterns to client connections
- [ ] 1.4 Implement wildcard pattern matching for collection subscriptions
- [ ] 1.5 Add authentication context storage per client connection

## 2. WebSocket Routes
- [ ] 2.1 Add WebSocket route `/realtime/subscribe` in `runtime/app.py`
- [ ] 2.2 Implement connection handshake and authentication check
- [ ] 2.3 Handle subscription messages from clients
- [ ] 2.4 Implement unsubscribe and connection cleanup
- [ ] 2.5 Add ping/pong heartbeat mechanism for connection health

## 3. ORM Integration
- [ ] 3.1 Add realtime event hooks to `runtime/base_model.py`
- [ ] 3.2 Implement after_insert hook to broadcast 'create' events
- [ ] 3.3 Implement after_update hook to broadcast 'update' events
- [ ] 3.4 Implement after_delete hook to broadcast 'delete' events
- [ ] 3.5 Include changed record data in event payload

## 4. Event Broadcasting
- [ ] 4.1 Implement message serialization for realtime events
- [ ] 4.2 Create event format with type, collection, record, and action fields
- [ ] 4.3 Add broadcast method to send events to matching subscribers
- [ ] 4.4 Implement filter logic to match subscriptions to events
- [ ] 4.5 Add error handling for failed message delivery

## 5. Custom Events API
- [ ] 5.1 Add `app.realtime_broadcast()` method for custom events
- [ ] 5.2 Support broadcasting to specific collections
- [ ] 5.3 Support broadcasting to specific client IDs
- [ ] 5.4 Add custom event payload support

## 6. Client Library
- [ ] 6.1 Create JavaScript client helper in `runtime/static/realtime-client.js`
- [ ] 6.2 Implement WebSocket connection management
- [ ] 6.3 Add subscribe/unsubscribe methods
- [ ] 6.4 Implement event callback registration
- [ ] 6.5 Add automatic reconnection logic
- [ ] 6.6 Handle connection state (connecting, connected, disconnected)

## 7. Testing
- [ ] 7.1 Write integration tests for WebSocket connection
- [ ] 7.2 Test subscription pattern matching
- [ ] 7.3 Test automatic event broadcasting on CRUD operations
- [ ] 7.4 Test custom event broadcasting
- [ ] 7.5 Test client connection tracking and cleanup
- [ ] 7.6 Test authentication context preservation
- [ ] 7.7 Test concurrent multiple client subscriptions
- [ ] 7.8 Test wildcard subscription patterns

## 8. Documentation
- [ ] 8.1 Document WebSocket endpoint and protocol
- [ ] 8.2 Create examples for subscribing to collections
- [ ] 8.3 Document custom event broadcasting API
- [ ] 8.4 Add usage examples for common patterns
- [ ] 8.5 Document JavaScript client library API

## 9. Performance Considerations
- [ ] 9.1 Add subscription count metrics
- [ ] 9.2 Implement connection limits if needed
- [ ] 9.3 Test memory usage with many concurrent connections
- [ ] 9.4 Consider Redis pub/sub for horizontal scaling (optional)

## 10. Security
- [ ] 10.1 Validate authentication before allowing subscriptions
- [ ] 10.2 Implement permission checks for collection access
- [ ] 10.3 Prevent unauthorized access to realtime events
- [ ] 10.4 Add rate limiting for subscription requests
- [ ] 10.5 Sanitize event data to prevent information leakage
