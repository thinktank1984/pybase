# Add Bugsink Error Tracking

## Why

The application currently lacks centralized error tracking and monitoring capabilities. Adding Bugsink (a self-hosted, Sentry-compatible error tracking system) will enable developers to identify, diagnose, and resolve production errors more efficiently.

## What Changes

- Integrate emmett-framework/sentry extension for error tracking
- Configure Bugsink instance accessible at http://localhost:8000
- Capture and report application errors, exceptions, and performance metrics
- Add Docker configuration for Bugsink service
- Configure error reporting in Emmett application

## Impact

- Affected specs: `error-tracking` (NEW)
- Affected code:
  - `runtime/app.py` - Sentry extension initialization
  - `docker/docker-compose.yaml` - Bugsink service configuration
  - `setup/requirements.txt` - Add emmett-sentry dependency
  - Docker configuration for Bugsink container
- Affected infrastructure:
  - New Bugsink service running on port 8000
  - Error reporting configuration
