# Add Type Checking with MonkeyType and Pyright

## Why

The codebase currently lacks type annotations, making it difficult to catch type-related bugs during development and reducing IDE support for auto-completion and refactoring. Adding comprehensive type hints will improve code quality, developer experience, and maintainability by enabling static type checking and better tooling support.

## What Changes

- **Add Pyright** as the static type checker for the project
- **Add MonkeyType** to automatically infer and generate type hints from runtime traces
- **Generate type annotations** for all Python files in the codebase using MonkeyType
- **Configure Pyright** with appropriate settings for the Emmett framework
- **Update CI/CD** to run type checking on all commits
- **Add type checking scripts** to development workflow
- **Document type checking practices** in project documentation

## Impact

- **Affected specs**: 
  - NEW: `type-checking` - Type checking and static analysis capability
  - MODIFIED: `testing` - Add type checking to test workflow
- **Affected code**: 
  - All Python files in `runtime/` will receive type annotations
  - All Python files in `tests/` will receive type annotations
  - New configuration files: `pyrightconfig.json`, type checking scripts
  - Updated `requirements.txt` with MonkeyType and Pyright dependencies
  - Updated `docker/Dockerfile` to include type checking tools
  - Updated CI/CD workflows (if any) to run type checks
- **Breaking changes**: None (type hints are backward compatible)
- **Benefits**:
  - Catch type errors before runtime
  - Better IDE support (auto-completion, refactoring, documentation)
  - Self-documenting code through type annotations
  - Easier onboarding for new developers
  - Reduced debugging time
