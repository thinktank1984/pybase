# auth Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change add-user-role-system. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Role Model
The system SHALL provide a Role model following the Active Record pattern to represent user roles.

#### Scenario: Role creation
- **WHEN** an admin creates a new role with name and description
- **THEN** the role is persisted to the database with a unique name

#### Scenario: Role retrieval by name
- **WHEN** the system queries for a role by name
- **THEN** the role is returned if it exists, or None if not found

#### Scenario: List all roles
- **WHEN** the system requests all roles
- **THEN** all roles are returned ordered by name

### Requirement: Permission Model
The system SHALL provide a Permission model following the Active Record pattern to represent granular permissions.

#### Scenario: Permission creation
- **WHEN** a permission is created with name, resource, action, and description
- **THEN** the permission is persisted with format `{resource}.{action}` (e.g., `post.create`)

#### Scenario: Permission lookup
- **WHEN** the system checks if a permission exists by name
- **THEN** the permission is returned if it exists

#### Scenario: Permission grouping by resource
- **WHEN** the system queries permissions for a specific resource
- **THEN** all permissions for that resource are returned

### Requirement: Role-Permission Association
The system SHALL allow many-to-many relationships between roles and permissions.

#### Scenario: Assign permission to role
- **WHEN** an admin assigns a permission to a role
- **THEN** the role-permission association is created in the database

#### Scenario: Remove permission from role
- **WHEN** an admin removes a permission from a role
- **THEN** the role-permission association is deleted

#### Scenario: Get all permissions for a role
- **WHEN** the system queries permissions for a specific role
- **THEN** all associated permissions are returned

### Requirement: User-Role Association
The system SHALL allow many-to-many relationships between users and roles.

#### Scenario: Assign role to user
- **WHEN** an admin assigns a role to a user
- **THEN** the user-role association is created

#### Scenario: Remove role from user
- **WHEN** an admin removes a role from a user
- **THEN** the user-role association is deleted

#### Scenario: Get all roles for a user
- **WHEN** the system queries roles for a specific user
- **THEN** all associated roles are returned

#### Scenario: User has multiple roles
- **WHEN** a user is assigned multiple roles
- **THEN** the user has all permissions from all assigned roles

### Requirement: User Role Methods
The User model SHALL provide methods for role management and permission checking.

#### Scenario: Check if user has role
- **WHEN** the system checks if a user has a specific role by name
- **THEN** return True if the user has that role, False otherwise

#### Scenario: Check if user has any role
- **WHEN** the system checks if a user has any role from a list
- **THEN** return True if the user has at least one of the roles, False otherwise

#### Scenario: Check if user has permission
- **WHEN** the system checks if a user has a specific permission
- **THEN** return True if any of the user's roles grant that permission, False otherwise

#### Scenario: Get all user permissions
- **WHEN** the system requests all permissions for a user
- **THEN** return the union of all permissions from all user roles

### Requirement: Role-Based Route Protection
The system SHALL provide decorators to protect routes based on role requirements.

#### Scenario: Route requires specific role
- **WHEN** a route is decorated with `@requires_role('admin')`
- **THEN** only users with the admin role can access the route
- **AND** other users receive a 403 Forbidden response

#### Scenario: Route requires any of multiple roles
- **WHEN** a route is decorated with `@requires_any_role('admin', 'moderator')`
- **THEN** users with either admin or moderator role can access the route
- **AND** users without any of these roles receive a 403 Forbidden response

#### Scenario: Unauthenticated user access
- **WHEN** an unauthenticated user tries to access a role-protected route
- **THEN** the user receives a 401 Unauthorized response

### Requirement: Permission-Based Method Protection
The system SHALL integrate permission checks with Active Record model methods.

#### Scenario: Method requires permission
- **WHEN** a model method is decorated with `@requires_permission('post.delete')`
- **THEN** the method can only be called by users with that permission
- **AND** users without the permission receive a 403 Forbidden response

#### Scenario: Permission check bypassed for admin
- **WHEN** a user with admin role calls any permission-protected method
- **THEN** the call succeeds regardless of specific permissions
- **BECAUSE** admin role has superuser privileges

### Requirement: Default Roles
The system SHALL seed the database with default roles on initial setup.

#### Scenario: Admin role seeding
- **WHEN** the system runs initial setup
- **THEN** an "Admin" role is created with all permissions

#### Scenario: Moderator role seeding
- **WHEN** the system runs initial setup
- **THEN** a "Moderator" role is created with content management permissions

#### Scenario: Author role seeding
- **WHEN** the system runs initial setup
- **THEN** an "Author" role is created with permissions to manage own content

#### Scenario: Viewer role seeding
- **WHEN** the system runs initial setup
- **THEN** a "Viewer" role is created with read-only permissions

### Requirement: Permission Caching
The system SHALL cache user permissions in the session to minimize database queries.

#### Scenario: Permission check uses cache
- **WHEN** a user's permissions are checked for the first time in a session
- **THEN** the permissions are loaded from database and cached in session

#### Scenario: Subsequent permission checks
- **WHEN** the same user's permissions are checked again in the same session
- **THEN** the cached permissions are used without database query

#### Scenario: Cache invalidation on role change
- **WHEN** a user's roles are modified
- **THEN** the permission cache for that user is invalidated
- **AND** permissions are reloaded on next check

### Requirement: Template Helper Functions
The system SHALL provide template helper functions for permission checks in views.

#### Scenario: Check permission in template
- **WHEN** a template uses `{{ current_user.has_permission('post.create') }}`
- **THEN** the template renders True or False based on user permissions

#### Scenario: Check role in template
- **WHEN** a template uses `{{ current_user.has_role('admin') }}`
- **THEN** the template renders True or False based on user roles

#### Scenario: Show/hide UI elements based on permissions
- **WHEN** a template conditionally renders elements based on permissions
- **THEN** users only see actions they are authorized to perform

### Requirement: Permission Naming Convention
The system SHALL enforce a consistent naming convention for permissions.

#### Scenario: Standard CRUD permission names
- **WHEN** permissions are created for a model
- **THEN** they follow the format `{model}.{action}` (e.g., `post.create`, `post.read`)

#### Scenario: Ownership-based permission names
- **WHEN** permissions distinguish between own and any resource
- **THEN** they use `.own` or `.any` suffix (e.g., `post.edit.own`, `post.edit.any`)

#### Scenario: Invalid permission name
- **WHEN** a permission is created with invalid format (missing dot, invalid characters)
- **THEN** validation fails with descriptive error message
