# error-tracking Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change add-bugsink-error-tracking. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Error Capture and Reporting
The system SHALL automatically capture unhandled exceptions and errors that occur during request processing and report them to a centralized error tracking service (Bugsink).

#### Scenario: Unhandled exception during request
- **WHEN** an unhandled exception occurs during HTTP request processing
- **THEN** the exception SHALL be captured with full stack trace
- **AND** request context (URL, method, headers, user) SHALL be included
- **AND** the error SHALL be sent to Bugsink asynchronously
- **AND** the user SHALL receive an appropriate error response

#### Scenario: Error with authenticated user
- **WHEN** an error occurs for an authenticated user
- **THEN** the error report SHALL include the user's ID
- **AND** sensitive user information (passwords, tokens) SHALL be scrubbed

#### Scenario: Duplicate errors
- **WHEN** the same error occurs multiple times
- **THEN** Bugsink SHALL group identical errors together
- **AND** each occurrence SHALL be tracked with count and timestamps

### Requirement: Bugsink Service Configuration
The system SHALL provide a Bugsink error tracking service accessible via Docker Compose configuration.

#### Scenario: Bugsink service startup
- **WHEN** Docker Compose is started
- **THEN** Bugsink SHALL start and be accessible at http://localhost:8000
- **AND** Bugsink SHALL be ready to receive error reports
- **AND** the Emmett application SHALL connect to Bugsink via configured DSN

#### Scenario: Bugsink data persistence
- **WHEN** Bugsink container is restarted
- **THEN** previously captured errors SHALL be preserved
- **AND** error history SHALL remain accessible

### Requirement: Error Tracking Configuration
The system SHALL support configurable error tracking behavior via environment variables.

#### Scenario: Enable error tracking
- **WHEN** SENTRY_ENABLED environment variable is set to "true" (or unset, defaulting to true)
- **THEN** error tracking SHALL be active
- **AND** errors SHALL be reported to Bugsink

#### Scenario: Disable error tracking
- **WHEN** SENTRY_ENABLED environment variable is set to "false"
- **THEN** error tracking SHALL be disabled
- **AND** the application SHALL run normally without sending error reports

#### Scenario: Custom DSN configuration
- **WHEN** SENTRY_DSN environment variable is provided
- **THEN** the application SHALL use the specified DSN for error reporting
- **AND** errors SHALL be sent to the configured endpoint

### Requirement: Performance Monitoring
The system SHALL capture performance metrics to identify slow requests and operations.

#### Scenario: Request performance tracking
- **WHEN** performance monitoring is enabled
- **THEN** request duration SHALL be tracked
- **AND** slow requests SHALL be identified
- **AND** performance data SHALL be viewable in Bugsink dashboard

#### Scenario: Sampling rate configuration
- **WHEN** performance monitoring sampling rate is configured
- **THEN** only the specified percentage of requests SHALL be tracked
- **AND** error tracking SHALL remain at 100% regardless of sampling

### Requirement: Error Context and Metadata
The system SHALL capture relevant context information with each error to facilitate debugging.

#### Scenario: Request context capture
- **WHEN** an error occurs during a request
- **THEN** the error SHALL include HTTP method, URL path, and query parameters
- **AND** relevant headers SHALL be captured (excluding sensitive ones)
- **AND** request body SHALL be included if available

#### Scenario: Environment information
- **WHEN** an error is captured
- **THEN** the error SHALL include Python version, Emmett version
- **AND** environment name (development, production) SHALL be tagged
- **AND** server hostname SHALL be included

#### Scenario: Custom tags
- **WHEN** the application adds custom tags to an error context
- **THEN** those tags SHALL be included in the error report
- **AND** tags SHALL be searchable in Bugsink

### Requirement: Integration with Emmett Application
The error tracking system SHALL integrate seamlessly with Emmett framework patterns and lifecycle.

#### Scenario: Extension initialization
- **WHEN** the Emmett application starts
- **THEN** the Sentry extension SHALL initialize if enabled
- **AND** the extension SHALL register with Emmett's ASGI pipeline
- **AND** application startup SHALL not fail if Bugsink is unavailable

#### Scenario: Graceful degradation
- **WHEN** Bugsink is unavailable or unreachable
- **THEN** the application SHALL continue processing requests
- **AND** errors SHALL be logged locally as fallback
- **AND** error reporting attempts SHALL timeout appropriately

### Requirement: Development and Testing Support
The system SHALL support error tracking testing and verification in development environments.

#### Scenario: Test error endpoint
- **WHEN** a developer accesses a test error endpoint
- **THEN** an intentional exception SHALL be raised
- **AND** the error SHALL be captured and sent to Bugsink
- **AND** the developer can verify error tracking is working

#### Scenario: Error verification
- **WHEN** an error is captured
- **THEN** the developer can view it in Bugsink dashboard at http://localhost:8000
- **AND** full stack trace SHALL be visible
- **AND** request context SHALL be displayed
