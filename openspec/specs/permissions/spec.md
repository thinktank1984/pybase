# permissions Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change add-user-role-system. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Permission System Architecture
The system SHALL provide a role-based permission system integrated with the Active Record pattern, allowing fine-grained access control through decorators and configuration. The permission system uses a many-to-many relationship between users, roles, and permissions, with roles acting as permission containers.

#### Scenario: Define model permissions
- **WHEN** a model class includes a Meta.permissions dictionary
- **THEN** the system registers those permissions for authorization checks
- **AND** the permissions follow the format `{model}.{action}.{scope}` (e.g., `post.edit.own`)

#### Scenario: Permission decorator on method
- **WHEN** a model method is decorated with `@requires_permission('resource.action')`
- **THEN** the method can only be executed by users with that permission
- **AND** unauthorized access raises a 403 Forbidden error

#### Scenario: Superuser bypass
- **WHEN** a user has the admin role
- **THEN** all permission checks pass regardless of specific permissions
- **BECAUSE** admin role grants superuser privileges

#### Scenario: Multiple permissions required
- **WHEN** a method requires multiple permissions (AND logic)
- **THEN** the user must have all specified permissions to execute
- **AND** missing any one permission results in 403 error

### Requirement: Auto-Generate Permissions from Models
The system SHALL automatically generate standard CRUD permissions for models with auto-generation enabled.

#### Scenario: Generate permissions for new model
- **WHEN** a model inherits from ActiveRecord with auto_generate_permissions=True
- **THEN** the system creates permissions: `{model}.create`, `{model}.read`, `{model}.update.own`, `{model}.update.any`, `{model}.delete.own`, `{model}.delete.any`

#### Scenario: Custom permission generation
- **WHEN** a model defines custom permissions in Meta.permissions
- **THEN** the system creates those permissions in addition to or instead of standard ones

#### Scenario: Permission synchronization
- **WHEN** the application starts
- **THEN** the system ensures all model-defined permissions exist in the database
- **AND** removes permissions for deleted models if configured

### Requirement: Permission Inheritance Through Roles
The system SHALL allow roles to inherit permissions from other roles.

#### Scenario: Role hierarchy
- **WHEN** a role is configured to inherit from another role
- **THEN** users with the child role have all permissions from parent role
- **AND** the child role can have additional permissions beyond parent

#### Scenario: Multi-level inheritance
- **WHEN** roles are configured in a hierarchy (e.g., Admin > Moderator > Author)
- **THEN** permissions cascade through all levels
- **AND** circular inheritance is prevented with validation error

### Requirement: Ownership-Based Permissions
The system SHALL distinguish between permissions for own resources versus any resources.

#### Scenario: Edit own resource
- **WHEN** a user has `post.edit.own` permission
- **THEN** the user can edit only posts where they are the owner
- **AND** editing others' posts is denied

#### Scenario: Edit any resource
- **WHEN** a user has `post.edit.any` permission
- **THEN** the user can edit any post regardless of ownership

#### Scenario: Ownership field configuration
- **WHEN** a model specifies Meta.ownership_field = 'user'
- **THEN** that field is used to determine resource ownership
- **AND** ownership checks compare the field value to current user ID

### Requirement: Permission Audit Trail
The system SHALL maintain an audit log of permission grants and revocations.

#### Scenario: Log role assignment
- **WHEN** a role is assigned to a user
- **THEN** the assignment is logged with timestamp, admin user, and reason

#### Scenario: Log permission modification
- **WHEN** permissions are added or removed from a role
- **THEN** the change is logged with details of what changed and who made the change

#### Scenario: Query permission history
- **WHEN** an admin requests permission history for a user
- **THEN** all role assignments and revocations are returned in chronological order

### Requirement: Conditional Permissions
The system SHALL support permissions that depend on runtime conditions.

#### Scenario: Time-based permission
- **WHEN** a permission has a time constraint
- **THEN** the permission is only active during specified time window

#### Scenario: Context-dependent permission
- **WHEN** a permission check includes context data
- **THEN** the permission system evaluates context against permission rules
- **AND** grants or denies based on context evaluation

#### Scenario: Dynamic permission evaluation
- **WHEN** a model method requires dynamic permission evaluation
- **THEN** the system calls a permission evaluator function with current context
- **AND** uses the return value to allow or deny access

### Requirement: Permission Groups
The system SHALL allow grouping related permissions for easier assignment.

#### Scenario: Create permission group
- **WHEN** permissions are logically related (e.g., all blog management permissions)
- **THEN** they can be assigned to a role as a group

#### Scenario: Bulk permission assignment
- **WHEN** a role is assigned a permission group
- **THEN** all permissions in that group are granted to the role

#### Scenario: Permission group modification
- **WHEN** a permission is added to a group
- **THEN** all roles with that group automatically gain the new permission
