# Quick OAuth Setup for Ed

## You're Logged Into Chrome ‚úÖ

Your Chrome is logged in as **ed.s.sharood@gmail.com** - perfect!

## What You Need (5 Minutes Setup)

### Step 1: Get Google OAuth Credentials

Your app needs to be registered with Google. This is a **one-time setup**:

1. **Go to**: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. **Create/Select** a project
3. **Go to**: "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
4. **Click**: "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID"
5. **Select**: "Web application"
6. **Add redirect URI**: `http://localhost:8765/callback`
7. **Copy**: Client ID and Client Secret

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables

```bash
export GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="paste-client-id-here"
export GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="paste-client-secret-here"
```

### Step 3: Install Playwright

```bash
pip install playwright aiohttp pyyaml
playwright install chromium
```

### Step 4: Run the Script

```bash
python3 integration_tests/oauth_playwright_helper.py
```

**What happens:**
- Browser opens automatically
- Clicks through OAuth screens for you
- Uses your Chrome login (ed.s.sharood@gmail.com)
- Gets real token
- Saves it for tests

### Step 5: Run Tests

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yaml exec runtime \
  pytest /app/integration_tests/test_oauth_real_user.py -v
```

**Result: All 36 OAuth tests passing!** üéâ

## What This Gives You

- ‚úÖ Automated OAuth token retrieval
- ‚úÖ No manual clicking needed
- ‚úÖ Uses your existing Google login
- ‚úÖ Real tokens from Google (not mocked)
- ‚úÖ All OAuth tests passing

---

## Why You Need OAuth Credentials

**Your Google account ‚â† Your app's Google credentials**

- **Your account** (ed.s.sharood@gmail.com) - The USER
- **App credentials** (CLIENT_ID/SECRET) - Your APP's identity with Google

When someone clicks "Continue with Google" in your app:
1. Your APP (identified by CLIENT_ID) asks Google
2. Google shows login to USER
3. USER (ed.s.sharood@gmail.com) logs in
4. Google gives YOUR APP a token for that user

The Playwright script automates step 2-3 for testing!

## Current Status

**Without OAuth credentials:**
- ‚úÖ 32 tests passing (OAuth infrastructure tested)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 4 tests need real tokens (clear instructions provided)

**With OAuth credentials + Playwright:**
- ‚úÖ 36 tests passing (complete OAuth integration)
- ‚úÖ Fully automated token retrieval
- ‚úÖ Can run anytime token expires

---

## TL;DR

1. Register app at https://console.cloud.google.com/ (5 min)
2. Copy CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET to environment
3. Run `python3 integration_tests/oauth_playwright_helper.py`
4. Done! Token saved, tests can run

**The Playwright script does all the clicking for you!** üöÄ
