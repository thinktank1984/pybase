Sending mails
=============

Sooner or later you will need to send mails to your users from your application. Emmett provides a simple interface to set up SMTP with your application and to send messages to your users.

Let's start configuring a simple mailer within our application:

```python
from emmett import App
from emmett.tools import Mailer

app = App(__name__)
app.config.mailer.sender = "nina@massivedynamic.com"

mailer = Mailer(app)
```

With just these lines the mailer is ready to send messages, using the local machine as the SMTP server and sending messages from the address *nina@massivedynamic.com*.

The mailer also accepts additional configuration parameters, here is the complete list:

| parameter | default value | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sender | `None` | the address to use for the *From* value |
| server | 127.0.0.1 | the SMTP host to use |
| port | 25 | the SMTP port to use |
| username | `None` | the username to authenticate with (if needed) |
| password | `None` | the password to authenticate with (if needed) |
| use\_tls | `False` | decide if TLS should be used |
| use\_ssl | `False` | decide if SSL should be used |

Now, let's see how to send messages.

Sending messages
----------------

We can create a simple message using the `mail` method of our mailer:

```python
message = mailer.mail(
    subject="Hello", 
    body="A very important message",
    recipients=["walter@massivedynamic.com"])
```

and add another recipient later:

```python
message.add_recipient("william@massivedynamics.com")
```

and when we are ready, we can just send it:

```python
message.send()
```

We can also create a message and send it directly:

```python
mailer.send_mail(
    subject="Hello", 
    body="A very important message",
    recipients=["walter@massivedynamic.com"])
```

or set an html content for the message:

```python
message.html = "<b>Testing</b>"
```

Attachments
-----------

Once you created a message, adding attachments is quite easy:

```python
msg = mailer.mail(subject="See this")

with open("image.png") as fp:
    msg.attach(filename="image.png", data=fp.read())

msg.recipients = ["walter@massivedynamic.com"]
msg.send()
```

> **Note:** The default encoding used by the mailer is utf-8.

Tests and suppression
---------------------

When you are testing your application, or if you are in a development environment, itâ€™s useful to be able to suppress email sending. Still, you may want to test some message was generated in your code, and you want to catch it.

The mailer provide a `store_mails` method for this, so you can just write down:

```python
with mailer.store_mails() as outbox:
    mailer.send_mail(
        subject='testing', body='test', recipients=["foo@bar.com"])
    assert len(outbox) == 1
    assert outbox[0].subject == "testing"
```

and the mailer just avoid the *real sending* of the message.

If you want to totally disable email sending, you can use the `suppress` parameter in the configuration:

```python
app.config.mailer.suppress = True
```

This will completely disable message sending.
